# Clients
Here we have various clients written in python flask, which interact with the respective user and Fabric Network.
The user interfaces are written in React.

First start the python clients, e.g. `python3 ./managing_org/mo_client.py`. Note: always start the MO first.
Next start the react GUIs from the folder, e.g.:
```
cd managing_org/mo-webui
npm start
```
